#BC-9-JIBIZA

**A project done in fullfillment of the application process for Andela Cohort 9**

>Why Jibiza? 
Jibiza is a swahili word meaning 'answer back' as translated into English thus the name I settled for in regards to the **Quizz Application** project that I was assigned to accomplish.

The Quiz Application is a ***console*** based application that should be used to present multiple choice questions that need be answered 

The required commands for the application were:

1. `quiz list` - List of all the available quizzes in your library

2. `quiz import <path_to_quiz_JSON>` - Import a new quiz from a JSON file

> JSON Format for Quizzzes should contain the following keys: 

`questions` - List of questions in the quiz
`text` - Question text
`options` - List of options for the question
`.is_answer` - Parameter of an option that can be true or false. Indicates whether or not that option is the correct answer.
`quiz take <quiz_name>` - Start taking a new quiz

3. When a user takes a quiz he gets a score based on the answers he got right

4. Timing can be added to quiz as a parameter in the JSON

5. As a user I can import quizzes from JSON files

6. Add in an online quiz repository using Firebase (extra credit)
